Veloren is available on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and the Steam Deck.

Veloren draws inspiration from a variety of games such as *Cube World*, *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, and
*Dwarf Fortress*.

Development of Veloren, which began in the summer of 2018, is driven entirely by the game's community, with all source
code and assets in the public domain, licensed under GPL 3. Members of the community including programmers, artists,
musicians, designers, and testers come together to develop the game.
