# Website Update by @Tub

> The following was written around Christmas

With work quieting down over the holidays, I finally found some time to get back to an unfinished project: the website redesign. The most obvious change is that I removed the header and used the image as a background instead. The second most obvious one (and the whole point of the redesign) was to add a proper start page that's more than just a list of devblogs.

Behind the scenes, the whole theme was moved into the directory root. This has a couple of advantages: it's easier to work on, as zola doesn't currently detect changes in theme files. It avoids filename collisions between /static/ and /theme/veloren/static/. It allows us to merge all css files into one via scss for slightly faster page loads. And lastly, it gets rid of a couple of unused files.

I've added a shortcode to insert images into the devblogs. This uses a proper semantic layout with <figure> and <figcaption>, which search engines may be happy about. It no longer requires javascript to resize the images; reducing jitter during loads.
What remains is to pick four (or two or six..) current screenshots for the start page. I'll leave that to someone else. Just put them in static/ and change the filenames in content/home.md.
And of course there may be further bugs, feature requests etc. I'll do my best to hop in every now and then over the holidays.

# Airshipper Progress by @Songtronix

Last time I've shown the concept art on how Airshipper should look like:

Thanks to the wonderful help of @Timo with his constant effort to make it real we're finally approaching a consumer-ready GUI.
Before spoiling you with the final version, let's follow us on our journey on how we have done it!

@Timo started to work on the layout of the UI:

> ugly but a start

And already after a little bit of time he has almost done it:

> we even show the changelog now!

After some finishing touches he's done the layout of the UI!

> looking good so far!

Well, if you look closely you can see a slider beside the play button. _Why?_ Well until then there was no progress bar in the GUI library which can fill up nicely while downloading the game.
As I always wanted to contribute to [iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) I thought this is the chance! So I've done it and I loved the process of doing so!
After my [Merge Request](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/pull/141) has been accepted I played around with it for about an hour

> I still do this every day...

And then with some customization efforts by @Timo:

> and songtronix is the coolest ^^

Leaving out all the backend horror we have like making the download button do the actual thing, I have put some efforts to get the UI closer to the design by showing the blogposts and even add buttons which link to the respective blog! For all the poor souls with a bad internet connection: Do not worry, we cache the news and changelog and only download the whole thing if it actually has changed.

Now let's see airshipper actually starting the game:
