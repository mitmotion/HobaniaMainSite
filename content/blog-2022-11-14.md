If you want to get a glimpse into the difficulties and debugging aids to implement tracks you can take a look into [these series of posts in #rendering](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/467073814208053248/1039222013312639056).

## instrument crafting

@Pfau started a [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/1036737546954211449/1036737550150291517) about instrument crafting and received a lot of feedback.

## Savannah pits

The merge of the savannah pits, a new town type, got lost during the pre-Halloween preparations, 
now with some minor fixes merged this week we feature a picture from within this town type:

## Roshwalr attacks by @Ythern

@Ythern continued their work on giving the Roshwalr a specific attack capability

which then lead to an interesting discussion about the animation building up the attack and a reworked proposal by @floppy
