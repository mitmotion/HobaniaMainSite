# Welcome to Veloren!

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. It is inspired by games such
as Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and
Minecraft.

Veloren is fully open-source, licensed under GPL 3. It uses original graphics,
musics and other assets created by its community. Being contributor-driven, its
development community and user community is one and the same: developers,
players, artists and musicians come together to develop the game.
