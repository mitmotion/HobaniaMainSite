# High quality upscaling by @zesterer

For those that run Veloren with a low internal resolution, I made some changes
that might improve the game for you:

Firstly, I realised that the way we applied FXAA at internal resolutions other
than 1.0x was incorrect.  After fixing this, FXAA does its job more effectively
at lower internal resolutions.

Secondly, I added a HQX anti-aliasing option (although technically, it's less
anti-aliasing and more upscaling).  It attempts to take the low resolution
framebuffer generated by the game and perform edge detection to reconstruct the
original geometry.  It's by no means perfect, but I personally much prefer it
over both no anti-aliasing and FXAA at very low internal resolutions.

Here's a comparison at 0.25x internal resolution between no-AA, FXAA, and HQX:
