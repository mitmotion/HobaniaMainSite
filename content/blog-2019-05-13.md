## 0.2 Task Meeting

### Task reassessment and milestone definition

This week, a group of contributors met to reassess the tasks to be completed for the 0.2 milestone. The key focus points were determining what still needed to be done, and what was assigned to the 0.2 milestone that could be pushed to 0.3. To encompass both points, a definion of the milestone was created.

> TODO

By looking at this definition, we could more easily see what problems were out of scope of 0.2. Another deciding factor was which tasks were required to make a requirement work, and which would be just nice to have. Nice to have ones were moved to 0.3, and if there is time at the end of 0.2, then we can start pulling tasks from 0.3.
