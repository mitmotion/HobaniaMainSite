# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @zesterer, @UncomfySilence, @Christof, @flo,
@XVar, @ubruntu, @tygyh, @Slipped, @Snowram, @IsseW, @Sam, @xMAC94x, and
@EvenMeek!

## Armor @Ubruntu

I worked on item tooltips so that armors don't show stats that have a value of
0. This makes armor tooltips more compact and their stat benefits more
immediately apparent. New armor stats can now be added in the future without
worrying about excessive clutter to tooltips on unrelated armors.

## @James

I made armor stats optional as far as the code is concerned which will allow us
to add more armor stats without having to add zero values to a bunch of armor
pieces that wouldn't have a given stat
