 - Moving to a tracking issue for all ideas

    Working on Halloween town decorations
    Carved pumpkin model
    Villager costumes
    Moon recolouring
    NPC lantern changes
        Green or orange
    Create a broom model for a glider
    Town NPCs get a spooky hat
    NPCs are more inclined to using furry/scary clothing
    Draugrs spawn in the wild and drop candy
    Exclusive candy drops
        Would need the model created

## Server browser retrospective

How has it been going?

    Overall, many communities have had more visibility on their servers
    It’s quite easy to see nearby servers
    Servers can specity which region they’re in
    Number of players on the main game server is currently hovering around a reasonable number (~150)

What are some things we’ve heard people want

    Communities want to feel more official
        Only the main game server gets a star, and there is only one of them
    Larger communities want methods to share characters between servers
    Player count on servers
    I’d like to be able to see which “federation” I can connect to with my current credentials, and how my characters can be shared across servers
        This is quite dependent on the new auth system

What are the next steps?

    Work on the new auth system
        Being worked on by Nadja
                XVar, Sharp, imbris…
    Work on the player count
        How are the config/status of the server being shared with Airshipper?
    Much is being discussed in this thread: V3650 DRAFT Added Query Server to Veloren Server
        There are issues of servers just sharing arbitrary information
