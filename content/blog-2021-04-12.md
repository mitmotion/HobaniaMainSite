# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @xMAC94x, @Ceikry, @XVar, @juliancoffee,
@Sam, @VincentFoulon80, @Sharp, @Pfau, @aweinstock, @DaforLynx, @law4x, @hqurve,
@imbris, @BuildTools, @Snowram, @mdx97, @davidruizagustin2002, @ccm7676,
@UMR1352, @zesterer, @Desttinghim, @romulans, @James, and @kimamb!

@Sam overhauled loot tables to allow them to recursively reference other loot
tables in addition to items. @Destinghim added travelers back into the game and
made them follow paths. @Ceikry added a setting for resetting inputs when chat is
opened. They also added ctrl-click and shift-click info to item tooltips when trading, and
updated the book slightly.

@Ultimafounding has some plans for some new music in
the next few weeks. There is also a lot of other audio content coming in from
@Flashbang, @DaforLynx, @Aeronic, @badbbad, and alfy. Songs have also been
revamped for distribution over biomes.

@Pfau has been working on some new map mode button visuals.
