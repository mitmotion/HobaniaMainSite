# Axe skill tree work by @Sam

As the axe skill tree rework nears its completion, it is time to start collecting ideas that will be used in the hammer rework.

The hammer's intended play style is to provide crowd crontrol and support.

The abilities in the hammer skill tree are broadly intended to deal a large amount of poise damage to stagger targets, and have a hefty amount of knockback to remove enemies from your allies.

Suggestions for the hammer abilities can be made in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nydiL6QnG73CxzE8LU2u19aeYRhz5VxdOynY27JdqHQ).
