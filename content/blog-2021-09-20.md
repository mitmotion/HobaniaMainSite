Hitboxes

It is a long story back then when I started combat balancing and loved shooting
stuff with bow because it's arguably most controllable weapon in the game with
quite high skill requirements. The issue is that at that time we had
singleplayer map with desert almost at spawn, you just needed to glide from
mountain and all of us loves gliding, yes? And one of them most frequent
inhabitants of desert are camels. How hitboxes relate to Camels, you would ask?
Well, look at this picture.

Mon dessin num√©ro 1. Camel hitbox.

}}

How this happened? Well, the most obvious answer is that its hitbox is not
greatly defined, look at height for example. Actually, it isn't defined at all
and it is using fallback dimensions. That's one of fundamental problem we need
to solve, but there are another problems. Look at this picture with clay golem's
hitbox. 

Picture 2. Clay Golem's hitbox from eye to eye.

}}

Height is ok, but some visual parts are clearly aren't there, you can't hit
hands at all! Why it was defined like that? Well, for this we need to look at
another picture.

Picture 3. Clay Golem's hitbox how you'll see if if you were bird and playing
with debug hitboxes.

You should start to see that something is wrong. This hitbox is very imprecise,
you can't hit his hands, but if you'll just hit in the air before him, you'll
actually shoot him. That's because our hitboxes are cylinders. So if you'll
increase radius to be able to hit hands, you will increase overall cylinder
radius. And you'll say: "But no one is shooting Clay Golem like that! Just make
radius big enough!". And I agree with you. But look at next pictures.

Picture 4 and 5. Fairy tails.

If we will allow you to be able hit Archaeos tail, its hitbox will become just
huge. So basically it says: "No matter how hard you try, hitboxes will suck".
Which is very sad.

That's what I was trying to fix. Why we use cylinders? It's fast and simple. If
you want to ask the question "is this point is inside or ouside of cylinder?"
you need to do two things. Compare z component of point and check that it's less
than top and more than bottom and calculate 2d distance between point and
cylinder: if it less than radius, then point is inside. So we want something as
simple which at the same time gives us ability to make our hitboxes better.

We've come up with capsule prisms. (I heard this idea from @zesterer [GMT+0]).
It's a prism (which means it has the same form at any height, contrary to for
example sphere, which has lesser radius on each Z-slice) with stadium as a base.
Stadium is simple figure which created by one segment and points around that
segment on equal distance. See? Equal distance, that's what we love about
cylinders. Some also call it like sausage body :cowboy_eyes: .

Picture 6. Stadium where Archimedes beats Zeus.

}}

So now if you need to calculate distance from point to our capsule prism you
need to check z component in exact same way as you do with cylinders, and then
compare the 2d distance between point and line segment. It's more complex than
distance between points, but it's still 2d which is still quite easy. It becomes
more complex when you need to answer the question what is the distance between
line segments, that's where I wanted to thank @zesterer [GMT+0] for this formula
and @imbris [GMT-4] for some tweaks to formula to make it more reliable in edge
cases. In the end I would like to show picture of hitboxes for Camel and
Cyclops.

Picture 7 and 8. Sausage guys.

This is backend change to our physics, but we still need to actually make our
hitboxes good, stay tuned! If you read this on our Blog, the chances are that
Husks hitboxes aren't that bad now. Picture 9. The secret of cultist dungeons.
Headless Husks.

## @anomaluridae

For cursor curmudgeons:

Have you ever tried collecting a mushroom in a cave, but since you are holding
your pick axe, your cursor keeps detecting the ore (and not the fungi clearly
under your crosshairs)? Are you forced to un-equip your pickaxe first (a.k.a.
leave mining mode), in order to satisfy your fungi fanaticism?

Have you ever been in build mode, but still want to pull out your pickaxe and
start mining at the same time? Without leaving build mode? Have you noticed that
when you are trying to mine while in build mode, you often end up vaporizing
your precious ore (a.k.a. removing the block) instead of getting that loot?

Well, now you can!

The previous method did an order of precedence based upon a presumed preferred
action. It assumed building (when in build mode), was preferred over mining
(when holding your pick axe), was preferred over anything else.

The updated method takes an order of precedence based upon the nearest target
under your cursor. (It also does some refactoring to de-tangle a few things, and
separate concerns into separate abstractions.)

Big thanks to @imbris [GMT-4] for his patience with this first-time veloren
contributor.

## @Sam

I have refactored how health works. Some of you who peaked around the ability
asset files or looked into the code may have noticed that health was scaled by a
factor of 10 compared to the value you would have expected. This was originally
done to allow for more granular health changes than whole numbers as we keep
health an integer. However it also had the problem that it could be tedious to
remember when changing abilities or reasoning about the total amount that would
change with buffs. To solve this health will now only retain the scaling within
the health module, and functions that externally interact with health use non
scaled values. Further, we opted to have all external interactions with health
use floats instead of integers as in practically all cases it is more convenient
to do, and it requires fewer casts between the two. The scaling was also changed
from a factor of 10 to a factor of 256 in order to make full use of the
precision offered by floats. Now this change was meant to be purely a backend
change, so ideally no one would have noticed any difference after the fact,
however there were a few sneaky bits that I missed in the conversion, such as
exp reward calculations, the health stat in the inventory menu, and damage
values from lava, bombs, campfires, and fireworks. A similar refactoring will
happen and is in progress for energy, and will be started soon for poise.

## @Snowram

I did some minor things :
- Fixed the fact projectile initial spawn. They used to always spawn inside the
  entity that fire them, now they spawn in front of it
- Added a box behind the debug text so that you can finally see it when it is on
  top of a cloud (transparency level follows chat setting)
