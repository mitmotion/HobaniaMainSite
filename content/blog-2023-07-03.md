# Contributor Work

Thanks to last two weeks' contributors @zesterer, @xMAC95x, @Pfau, @walpo, @Christof, @Isse, @floppy, @Sam, @bd, @aweinstock, @tygyh, @Fengo.

The merged work includes anticheat mechanisms (speed limits), a new login background, bloom and cinematic shaders, version bumps, 
translation updates, wasmer update and `cfg(wasm32)` removal, a plugin fix, wildlife spawn changes, durability changes, confirmation
on one-way trades and item sorting by quantity.

Ongoing (unmerged) work is happening on loot changes, coastal town, wyverns, avoiding cave dungeon intersections, map exploration, tcp buffering, iron pan, consumable cost reduction, lantern adjustments, axe skill tree, spawn entities from debug UI, voxel model spawning (a fortress), removing the coin counter, NPC searching players, wind affecting gliders and dwarven quarry.

There was no weekly meeting in the past two weeks, but there was a release party.

# 0.15 Release

Of course, you have to watch the cool trailer for this week's release with matching music:

The release party recording is available at {{youtube(id="LWWiFaDp1-M")}}

During the party someone used a loophole in veloren's crafting mechanism to overload the server, a fix has been developed since then.

# Ongoing work

@Oguz did some [experiments](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/450039871650660374/1122605278123274330) with shiny indices, but the end result wasn't considered good enough - 
until shiny gets proper [implementation](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/1069340367855554690/1069411255200260106).
