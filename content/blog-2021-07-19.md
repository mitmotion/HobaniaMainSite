# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors,

@Dr. Dystopia has been I've been trying to resolve all clippy error suppressions


## Sharp

I've been working for a while now on this, but just to let you know I haven't disappeared--I'm doing a bunch of work directly in wgpu to improve its performance and API for native applications (including Veloren, of course!) as well as removing pretty much all of the locking (except for locks that are held very briefly for things like allocation, and locks that appear to be hard to eliminate due to the native drivers demanding synchronization).  I will probably have a bigger post to talk about this when I'm done as it's a fairly substantial change.

## aweinstock

I rebased some MRs that had been finished but not merged by @holychowders and @Savalige and got them merged. The former makes guards respond when villagers shout for help, and the latter causes melee enemies (most noticeably husks) to spread out, resulting in swarming behavior that reduces the number that can get hit by a single fireball, and causes them to surround you.

I adjusted spawning behavior to place players aboveground when logging in, which should eliminate the need to manually use /home to get unstuck. I also improved the PID controllers used for airships and retuned them (previously, the integral term was incorrectly discarding old samples instead of accumulating total error).

Additionally, I've added support for hats. No hats are currently accessible without /give_item, but the support for them being added is there.

## Pfau

I worked on two icons this week:

Airshipper icon
I also continued concepting the crafting window overhaul. 
The new crafting window will hopefully show things like:
- crafting trees (with ingredients for ingredients)
- More info about ingredients ("What can I craft with this?" "Where do I get it?")
- More user friendly representation of armour tiers and sets
- More filters

## julian

Small AI fixes. AI now knows how to interact in this evil world and don't stuck three seconds waiting to be killed. Travelers don't hunt their target forever, and get calm after one kill. Merchants don't stuck in battle trying to eat curry. Cultists target their leaps better and not just flying to the other end of the room. Also AI now uses glider better which reduces their chances to die from falling.

Charge animals (wolves, mammoths, etc) and spear warriors don't double-hit while dash.

Moved wildlife spawn rules to .ron configs, which opens possibilities for easier balancing and testing.

## princess

I added SFX to the Asp Animal (Creature) in game.
Its the first animal to have SFX for all three states (to my knowledge)
(angry, calm and hurt)
The clips are Royalty Free, and have been edited to fit in, some are recordings from others open sources.
I measured them against a few other in game creature/animal sounds, and found that they sound about right at -5db.

It is my first contribution towards the development of Veloren and being part of a team on Gitlab.
a Lot of gratitude goes out to the people who have guided and helped me, thank you. I am looking forward to adding my next SFX contribution soon.
