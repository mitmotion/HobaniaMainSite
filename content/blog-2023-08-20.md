# Multiple singleplayer worlds in voxygen by @Isse

I've been working on having multiple singleplayer worlds in voxygen, which you will see in the game soon. Which will allow players 
to more easily generate different maps to play on. And your current singleplayer world will be migrated to this new system, so progress won't be lost.

As it is currently it's not really a user facing thing to generate maps. So I'm looking forward to more interesting maps being generated!
