# Stories with Veloren

@darin755: "I found Veloren after searching for FOSS games other than Minetest. I started playing it and was blown away by how detailed and complex the game is."

@RunRobDog: "After months upon months of playing Veloren i still play it now and then because it's just straight up a good game, especially to consider how early it is in development"

@acrimon: "i've been here a darn long time too i feel
not as early as lunar but still early
veloren had like 20 peeps or something caring about it?
i think zest convinced me this was a good idea"

@Treeco "I can't remember how I learned of it honestly, it wasn't a CubeWorld route, though I happened to join the day CW died so that was a bit of a mess.
I mostly just sit in the Discord and argue with people so I never feel I have much to say for these things sadly.
I remember the blog posts more than the game itself from early on, somehow? Following what was going on - rivers, at the time. I think I joined the server to follow that better, and then eventually got in to help test them, then got bullied into learning to compile so Sharp didn't have to manually start off a build with every push. Good times honestly.
I guess the arguing began as it became more of a game, and my ideas for what kind of game I'd like to see solidified. The simulation aspects were what drew me to the project, and trying to get decent gameplay while not compromising that is an interesting problem. (And subjective as all hell of course)
(All in good fun, I'm phrasing it as arguing but I think it all stays fairly chill most of the time?)
(I don't know if any of this is worth including in a writeup though. And the end I haven't done much, I guess. Might be imposter syndrome talking, but tbh I probably am the imposter)
(Don't amogus me, I fucking swear...)"

@LunarEclipse: "For me it was the comment on the cube world subreddit, I was the 4th person to join the discord iirc and offered to help with setting up  the server
then I learned rust to work on veloren"

# Long stories

@UncomfySilence: "Hello, most of you know me as Uncomfy. I first came across this game in the comment sections of one of many “CubeWorld’s Downfall” videos back in early April of 2021. I had a lot of free-time back then so I decided to download and boot this game up. The moment I stepped into the world of Veloren, only aware that it was a voxel game similar to CW, I was stunned by the visuals, animations, music, every little bit of the game I experienced. I sat glued to my little desk, walking around world for ~30 minutes, just exploring the various biomes and entities whilst muttering “wow” to myself. After familiarising myself with the game some more I decided that I wanted to become more knowledgeable about it and help in any way I could considering that it was open source.

I honestly didn’t really know how to approach this behemoth of an early development game and the thousands of people already seated within the discord server. I tried my hand at some art and some idea proposals but I mainly just ended up reading the new and unfolding discussions between some of the established members in the community. After some time just asking questions ingame and in discord about game mechanics I ended up with enough confidence to start answering questions from even newer members of the community. There was always the chance that I was wrong with a statement of mine, but I knew that there’d be a correction from someone more knowledgeable just around the corner. I simply wanted to be the one to help guide people that may have been as confused about certain mechanics as I was (considering that I didn’t know how to fix them code wise :P).
 
Over time I eventually became a moderator for Veloren, likely due to my continuous participation amongst the community. To each moderator there is a different meaning to the term “moderation”, even though at the end of the day moderation is just keeping the peace within Veloren. To me, moderating is trying to guide, discuss, enjoy my time, and interact with the community! So far I’ve greatly appreciated my time here amongst the lot of you, no matter how many circular debates ~~with treeco~~ I get into or  repetitive questions I answer! Hopefully I’ll get to see some of you ingame or on the discord server soon. :)"

@KaliKatz: "Moderation is just a job like any other, no spot light is really required.  recognition, sure..ok. 

As for the rules, that's going to be different for users and admins of there own servers. Should be up to the admin or admins to post the rules and regulations that there moderators use to police them. We have done that, the rules & info is posted already. We as moderators, should read and understand them, and then police on that basses. As for timeouts and bans, each would have a different case, going to be hard to make rules for each of them.  Generally I go with no timeouts and just perm ban.  Quite a lot of "people" listen and has worked for me.  But I am usually quite forceful, in reminding players, fun is fun, but were all real people in the end and hurt is hurt.  I don't reverse my decisions, and give pretty clear warnings before a perm ban. Kicking/killing merely wakes them up and reminds them that mods are real. On those that are clearly perm ban, easy. But easy moderating it isn't. Timeouts are good for those "jail" times, but they just instantly come back as alts, or don't bother coming back at all. Its simply easier to perm ban them away instead of micro-managing. Ban evasion is easy, the account page allows for this and should be made more challenging and slower to discourage griefers. But I have said that before.

So, about the guidelines... each server will have its own, we already have ours, maybe add some "new" rules to it from the already heavily used and somewhat abused #moderation-discussion.

As for a "spot light", in the end, its merely a self satisfying position...dirty...and no one really cares that you did a bad/good job. Its not for everyone. If its just for the free tp and tricks, then your just using them to play the game differently."

@DaforLynx

I formally joined Veloren development in August 2020, making music. At the time, 0.7 had *just* released. This little project seemed to me an incredible fortune to stumble upon - a true gem. An open-world game, open-source and open-development. The game itself captured my imagination, reminding me both of existing games I had put down and looked upon nostalgically and of games I had imagined making years ago.

The years have flown by and I have contributed to development enough that I am now an audio team lead. When I joined, there were 15 music tracks in the game. Now, there are 51. As the gameplay and visuals evolved, so did the audio experience, thanks to the efforts of many, many composers, sound designers, and coders.

However, I also see how far we have yet to go. The things I have in mind include a reorganized and revamped audio system, a potential library switch, adaptive music, and the long road to modernizing the audio experience.

Which reminds me: among the first tasks to do this year is a switch of all "rendered" assets to a Creative Commons license. Currently, all assets and source code are licensed under GPTv3, which doesn't actually contain provisions for assets specifically. Switching these assets, mainly including all music and sounds, to a new license would clear the water regarding their use and publishing in other projects. This switch hasn't happened yet, but will in the near future. We will need the consent of the owners of the assets to include them in the game after the license switch.
