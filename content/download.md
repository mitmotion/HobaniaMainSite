## Airshipper (Launcher)

Incase you get annoyed by the endless updates you manually need to download you can get the launcher right [here](https://www.songtronix.com).

## Mac OS

While Veloren does run on Mac OS, we don't currently produce builds for the platform. You can build Veloren from source yourself using the instructions in [the book](https://book.veloren.net).

## Nightly

Veloren is under heavy development. The nightly builds include many new features and bug fixes for issues in the last stable release and are _currently_ the _recommended version_ for playing the game.
