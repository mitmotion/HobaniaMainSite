# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Snowram, @XVar, @xMAC94x, @imbris, @tygyh,
@aweinstock, @juliancoffee, @Yusdacra, @drunkonhotcoco, @Slipped, @nwildner,
@teenjuna, @Danacus, @a1phyr, @SWilliamsGames, @zesterer, @Sam, and
@AidanTanneo!

@Songtronix In Preparations for Airshipper 0.4.3:
- fixes alot server side to validate alot of things before publishing and such server and client should stay in sync
- Windows 7/8 support is back (unexpected or badly formatted error) courtesy of Capucho's PR
- alot of other fixes

I also plan to bump iced version and as such upgrade to wgpu 0.9 / winit 0.25
and see how many graphical issues this will resolve for people.

@Snowram I have added 2 new species to compensate for the lack of wool, an alpaca (model by Gemu) and a llama (model by me), also added mammoth and ngoubou species (models by Gemu)

@snowramI substituted the cultists with warlock/warlord armour that were unavailable for
players by bigger and meaner species and added a buffed up version of the husk
for mini bosses rooms : the husk brute (models by Gemu)

@Sam I have worked on adding durations to potions and food (and this'll also be easily extendable to other item uses). 
What this will mean is that consumables are no longer instantaneously used, limited only by how fast you can spam a button. Now you will need to drink the potion or eat the food.
@Slipped [GMT -5] has made animations for both the drinking and eating

}}

@aweinstock I ported the dungeon generator from the sampling based approach to
site2's CSG generator, making it easier to modify.

}}

@juliancoffee I made a MR which sorts crafting tabs in logical order and splits
recipes from Dismantle and Material tabs

## @juliancoffee

Mindflayers were a little worried about cultists being too weak, someone even said that cultists are weaker than ants from Myrmidon dungeon! What nonsense!
Reforms were needed although, this is what everyone knew. Best of darksmiths worked on new armour. Orichalcum? Good choice, if you want to get hit, but cultist should be smarter than that. Dragonscale? Better, but still has less protection and while you can hit harder in it you lack stamina. Sunsilk solves this issue, but only if you consider a bunch of silk the armour. Cultists are best, they deserve to have this all!
And the darksmiths come up with the answer. Smith's chef-d'oeuvre gives its owner strength of any possible armour.
Mindflayer also get a better weapon with the flamethrower of such power so they hardly can handle it themself.
But not just piece of metal and heat of fire wins fights so Mindflayers gathered
the best warriors and gave them their power consumed from weaker ones so that
Mindflayer don't need to waste their corrupted spores...

# @ Contributer Announcement regarding contributing in our Gitlab Repository

Veloren's community is open and volunteer-driven. We welcome new contributors from all walks of life in our mission to build the best game we possibly can. Currently, we hand out 'developer'-level permissions to contributors on the main Veloren GitLab repository.
Long-term, this situation is untenable and will need reevaluating: GitLab's permission system is crude and doesn't allow us to control access permissions across branches, meaning that contributors have more permissions than are necessary to do their work.

The obvious alternative to this workflow is to have contributors fork the repository and contribute by upstreaming to the main repository through merge requests. However, this comes with some disadvantages:
- Collaboration between multiple contributors is harder: contributors must decide to work on a specific lead contributors fork, and will require permissions to do so, as well as adding the fork as a remote locally
- Continuous Integration (CI), the system for testing changes to the codebase before merge, will need to be manually set up for each fork.

For these reasons, we're going to be trialing a third solution: a dedicated 'contributor' repository where contributors can work on features as they do on the main repository today, but will open MRs against the main repository when features are complete. The main repository will be used only for branches authored by core developers, and the main branch/release tags.

## What this means for you

For contributors, the change in workflow should be minimal: the only change you'll need to make is to switch the URL of your 'origin' remote locally, and remembering to open an MR with the main repository when you feature is ready for review. All permissions, CI-related things, etc. will be handled by us. Shortly after a transition period, we will deactivate the developer rights on the main repo and ask you to switch to the `veloren/dev/veloren` repository permanently.

For developer this means you need to change the remote url
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:veloren/dev/veloren.git
```

We are happy to hear your feedback and questions in the respective channels ðŸ™‚

## FAQ:

### What exactly are the security concerns?
 
We will publish them in a blog-post once we this change is complete, to avoid tempting potential exploits.

### Will I still be able to use my Fork ?

Yes: the dev repo is optional. Feel free to continue forks, though we do recommend you join the dev repository in order to make your life easier.

### I have an ongoing MR on the veloren/veloren reposity. What do I need to do?

If you are a core developer or team lead nothing, you will keep access to the main repo until your MR is merged or closed. If you made the change in your fork, this will also be the case. If you made the change on the main repo but are neither a core developer nor a team lead, please contact me (xMAC94x). If you are currently working on a branch, please push that branch to the dev repository, using the same name.

### How do I join the dev repository?

We have already invited all members of `veloren/veloren` to the dev group. If you are not yet a member, apply here: https://gitlab.com/groups/veloren/dev/-/group_members and ping one of the core developers.

### Should I now `star`, `fork`, open issues on the `veloren/dev/veloren` repo instead?

No, please use our main repo `veloren/veloren` as the project's 'ground truth'. Only use the dev repo for development purposes.

### How do I open Merge Requests (MRs) now?

When you open a new MR in the dev repo, it should automatically have the target `veloren/veloren/master`. This means that the process should not differ in practice.
