updated.

# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @zesterer, Demonic, @Sam, @UncomfySilence,
@jon18, and @XVar!

## @Socksonme

I've recently touched up some of the textures for item drops. Instead of having
the default be BeastMeat, which isn't really that general, it's now Pouch. I've
also changed BipedLarge to use Pouch, much like how BipedSmall does, and Object
(for example, the turrets in tier 6 dungeons) now drops Chest instead of
BeastMeat. We'd eventually want to change how the item drop textures are chosen,
but as of now, they are based on the Body type of the entity, rather than the
actual items themselves.

## @Hannible

I am currently developing the architecture of different biomes and races for future villages, cities and towns. I do mockups on MagicaVoxel to show how potential biome sites could look. 
So far I have done one variant of desert biome rework and I am planning for the next few months to design the architecture of:

- Humans in plains
- Elves
- Danari
- Orcs

This should take me quite some time but will be a massive advancement in terms
of concept art for how we want Veloren architectures to look like.

Imported in Veloren and screend by @Treeco [GMT]
The desert city mockup I have done was imported on a Veloren test server in October to see how it would look and to see if the scale was right and it helped me see what could be improved in terms of design and layering. The biggest changes in the next mockups will include: 
More variants of houses and assets in general
More structures and pathed areas
Better polishing of the smaller assets

Of course we are a long way from having actual cities in the game but I do think it's important to start designing concepts now so we know what to aim for in the long term.
