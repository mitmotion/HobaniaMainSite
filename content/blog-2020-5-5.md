# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Zesterer, @Julian, @Pfau, @CapsizeGlimmer, @Songtronix, @Silentium, @Capucho, and @ProTheory8!

@CapsizeGlimmer added functionality to the lanterns in the game. @Pfau has been cleaning up NPC behavior, and adding assets.

@Silentium has been working on a huge increase to the quantity of weapons in the game. @Capucho and @Sharp continue to progress the wgpu branch.

# Lantern functionality from @CapsizeGlimmer !

A few weeks ago lanterns were merged into the game, but simply as items to be equipped and carried around, with real light in dungeons and nighttime still reliant on the /lantern command. That changed this week with @CapsizeGlimmer 's MR which not only makes lanterns functional, binding them to a key, but also adds colors to lanterns and light flickering animations!

In addition to lantern flickers, the waypoint bonfires will now do the same. The atmosphere of Veloren at night is starting to really come together.

# Audio work from @Julian and badbbad

Badbbad has gone to work this week on a new audio track for the game. Titled Highlands of the Hawk, it's seen as a wasteland type tune, meant for an Orc village type environment. Give the WIP track a listen here!

The next big task for audio is going to be battle themes, and trying to devise a way for the music to be able to shift naturally into a faster paced and more intense style of music when combat starts, without feeling disjointed. One solution is to create music with multiple layers, and having those layers fade in and out depending on the player's situation. Adaptive music is challenging, but badbbad is looking to experiment with it soon.

@Julian tweaked some of the sound effects in the game this week, moving away from more realistic metallic weapon sound effects for wielding into something a little more fitting to the overall style of the game. Pickup and drop sounds have also been tweaked.
